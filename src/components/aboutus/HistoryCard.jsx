            It all started with Colonel Harland Sanders, the man who convinced
            the world by saying “We do chicken right!” Sanders took a great deal
            of time perfecting his iconic secret recipe of 11 herbs and spices,
            a legacy he’s brought to the world through KFC’s 10,000+
            restaurants. Starting from outside of his gas station in Korbin,
            Kentucky to being a globally recognized face, we owe our success to
            the Colonel’s hard work and passion for sharing his love for chicken
            with the world!
